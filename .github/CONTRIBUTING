# Contributing to Plasmo

To contribute to [our examples](https://github.com/PlasmoHQ/examples/), please see **[Adding examples](#adding-examples)** below.

## Developing

The development branch is `main`, and this is the branch that all pull
requests should be made against.

To develop locally:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository to your own GitHub account and then [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) it to your local device.
2. Create a new branch:
    ```
    git checkout -b MY_BRANCH_NAME
    ```
3. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
4. Install the dependencies with:
    ```
    pnpm i
    ```
5. Start developing and watch for code changes:
    ```
    pnpm dev
    ```

## Building

You can build the project, including all type definitions, with:

    ```bash
    pnpm build
    ```

## Developing with your local version of Plasmo

There are two options to develop with your local version of the codebase:

### Set as local dependency in package.json

1. Link `plasmo` to your local registry:

    ```sh
    cd plasmo/cli/plasmo
    pnpm link --global
    ```

2. Invoke plasmo directly:

    ```sh
      plasmo init
      plasmo dev
      plasmo build
    ```

## Adding examples

When you add an example to the [examples](examples) repository:

- Use `pnpm plasmo init` to create the example.
- The name of the example should have a `with-*` prefix.
- To add additional notes, add `## Notes` section at the end of the generated readme.
